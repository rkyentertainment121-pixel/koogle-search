## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light pastel red (#FFB3B3), derived from the geometric background in the reference image, to match the spirit and feel of the app.
- Background color: Very light pastel red (#F8E7E7), close in hue to the primary color but greatly desaturated for a subdued, elegant appearance.
- Accent color: Light pastel orange (#FFD6B3), slightly more saturated than the primary color and complementary.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif), a font that will pair nicely with 'Poppins' and provides a warm and readable font for longer blocks of text.
- Use minimalist icons that reflect privacy, speed, and customization.
- Design a modern, minimal interface with a centered search bar, rounded edges, and a card-based layout for search results, inspired by Brave Browser.
- Incorporate smooth animations for search suggestions and page transitions.
